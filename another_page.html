			<h2>Layout</h2>
			<p>Planning the page layout was the most time-consuming part of the process, 
				as I didn’t have a clear starting point beyond the goal of creating a personal 
				website. I began by searching for potential photos and used Figma to design 
				the layout. After numerous iterations, the final results—some of which are displayed
				on the right—started to take shape. Ultimately, I selected the design featured 
				on the main page because it felt the most personal and aligned perfectly 
				with the site’s purpose.</p>

			<p>Initially, I considered using a full background image, but the subject 
				was too large and distracting from the main text. Instead, I opted for 
				an image on the left and text on the right, as this balanced the elements 
				better. To improve readability, I aligned the content in a grid-like format. 
				I used the float system for positioning the image, text, footer sections, navigation
				bar with the exception of the header.</p>

			<h2>Color Palettes</h2>
				<p>The color palettes used across these webpages were selected from 
					the main page's self-image photo. It was a challenging process, 
					involving a lot of trial and error, as there was no strict rule 
					on which colors to choose or where they should be applied. 
					Ultimately, the colors were picked based on their dominance and contrast,
					while ensuring they complemented both the image and the overall 
					aesthetic of the page. The goal was to create a visually harmonious 
					and balanced design.</p>

		<div class="col-1-2">
			<h2>Typography</h2>
				<p>I chose the Roboto font, designed by Christian Robertson, for the website's typography. 
					Its friendly and open curves create a welcoming feel, which I find ideal for a personal 
					website. Since the purpose of the site is simply to introduce myself—without conveying 
					any critical information—I wanted the reading experience to feel natural and relaxed, 
					complementing the overall design.</p>
